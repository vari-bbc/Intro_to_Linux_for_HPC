However, for archival purposes, we will still provide the platform-specific instructions to access the HPC on your laptop. 2.1.0.1 Mac users Open your terminal (search for the app) Type the following command to connect to the HPC. Replace firstname.lastname with your actual VAI username. ssh firstname.lastname@access.hpc.vai.org Enter your VAI password. (Note: you will not see the password as you type it, but it is working! Press your enter/return key when you’re done.) 2.1.0.2 Windows users If MobaXterm is not installed, please download the free MobaXterm version, then set up, and agree with license agreements to proceed installation. Open MobaXterm Click on Session in the top left corner Click on SSH(Secure Shell) Enter access.hpc.vai.org in the Remote host field Click the box on the left of Specify username, then enter your VAI username and password Click OK 2.1.1 OnDemand Instructions OnDemand is a web-based portal that lets you access the HPC resources right from your browser, without needing VPN or ssh tools on your local computer. You can read more about this on the HPC OnDemand sharepoint page. Below are the steps to access the HPC command line using OnDemand: Open a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) Go to the following URL: https://ondemand3.vai.zone/ if you see an error, try this instead: https://ondemandlocal.hpc.vai.org if neither or those links work, please let us know! Select “hpc Shell Access” from the list of several “pinned apps”. (“hpc Shell Access” is similar to the terminal on your laptop) Congrats – you’ve successfully connected to the HPC! 2.2 File navigation Practice directory: /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II. 2.2.1 Navigate to a directory (folder) cd - Change Directory. Allows you to navigate to a different directory (folder). Note the following special symbols: . refers to the folder you’re currently in (your “working” directory). .. refers to the folder before where you currently are - this is your “parent” directory. / is the root directory. ~ is your personal home directory. pwd - Print Working Directory. Displays the current directory (folder) you are in. # Display the current directory pwd # Change to the practice directory cd /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II # Display the current directory again to confirm the change pwd ## /home/kin.lau ## /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II 2.2.2 List content in a directory ls - list contents (files and folders). Without anything specified after ls, it will list what’s in the current directory. ls -lht – list contents, with added options (-l more details in a long list, -h human-readable sizes, -t sorted by modification time). ls foldername - list contents of the specified folder. Shows more details about the files and folders, ls ls -lht ls -lht /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II ls -lht ~ 2.2.3 Navigate back to home directory Without anything after cd, you will go to your home directory, which is /home/username (same as ~). # same as &quot;cd ~&quot; or &quot;cd /home/username&quot; cd # check: where are you now? pwd 2.2.4 Create a directory mkdir dir_name - will create a directory “dir_name” in your current directory. You will be creating a directory in your home drectory (because we just navigated to it). Make sure you are in your home directory first (use pwd), then create a directory called “hpc_workshop_2024” pwd mkdir hpc_workshop_2024 2.2.5 Copy a file cp - copy file/files Copy a file from /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II to the directory you just created. pwd cp /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II/metadata.tsv hpc_workshop_2024 ls hpc_workshop_2024 2.3 View and manipulate files 2.3.1 Display content cat - display the entire contents of a file. head - display the first 10 lines/rows of the a file. tail - display the last 10 lines/rows of the a file. You can use “-n” to control how many lines you want to see, default is 10. cd ~/hpc_workshop_2024 cat metadata.tsv head metadata.tsv tail metadata.tsv head -n 2 metadata.tsv The cat command can also be used to combine files. (This is where the command’s name comes from: concatenate) Note that we won’t run the command below, but keep this in mind for future reference. cat file1.txt file2.txt &gt; combined.txt 2.3.2 Pattern search grep - search a pattern by line pwd grep &quot;13&quot; metadata.tsv ## /home/kin.lau/hpc_workshop_2024 ## M 13 sample 13 replicate a ## Z 26 sample 13 replicate b 2.3.3 Display the number of lines, words, and characters wc - word count. It counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file. Adding the -l option afterwards just gives the number of lines in the file. wc metadata.tsv wc -l metadata.tsv ## 26 156 675 metadata.tsv ## 26 metadata.tsv 2.3.4 Pipe - redirection A pipe is a form of redirection (instead of printing output to the screen, it sends it to other destinations). You can send output from one command/program to another for further processing, such as: command 1 | command 2 | command 3. Above, the output from command 1 is used as input for command 2, and the output from command 2 is used as input for command 3. In the example below, we will use 3 commands subsequently to count the number of lines that contain the number “13” in the file. cat metadata.tsv | grep &quot;13&quot; | wc -l ## 2 2.3.5 Output redirection Instead of printing output to your screen (typical command output) or another command (pipe), you can redirect the output to a file. &gt; - redirect output to a file. Note that it will overwrite the file if it already exists – be careful! &gt;&gt; - append output to a file. It will add the output to the end of the file. # note that no output will be displayed on the screen -- it&#39;s saved in the file instead grep &quot;13&quot; metadata.tsv &gt; lines_with_13.tsv # check: do we see the file we just created? ls # display the content of the file cat lines_with_13.tsv ## combined.fq ## data_01_R1.fq ## data_54_R1.fq ## lines_with_13.tsv ## metadata.tsv ## M 13 sample 13 replicate a ## Z 26 sample 13 replicate b 2.4 Exercise Below, we’ll be doing something similar to the exercises above, but with real genomic data! We’ll be using a fastq file (format containing raw sequencing &amp; quality information). We will: copy fastq files from the practice directory to the folder you created combine the two fastq files into one count the number of reads in the combined file See if you can do each step on your own – if you get stuck, don’t worry! Try to remember the commands we’ve learned so far, and you can always refer back to the examples above. To check your work, you can view the commands below. 2.4.1 Step 1: Copy the files Once you’re in your hpc_workshop_2024 directory, copy the files data_01_R1.fq and data_54_R1.fq from the practice directory (/varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II) into your folder. Click here to see a solution cd ~/hpc_workshop_2024 cp /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II/data_01_R1.fq . cp /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II/data_54_R1.fq . 2.4.2 Step 2: Combine the files Combine the two fastq files into one file called combined.fq. Click here to see a solution cat data_01_R1.fq data_54_R1.fq &gt; combined.fq ls ## combined.fq ## data_01_R1.fq ## data_54_R1.fq ## lines_with_13.tsv ## metadata.tsv 2.4.3 Step 3: Count the number of reads Count the number of reads in the combined file. Hint #1 – what is a “read”? In a fastq file, reads start with the “@” symbol. Hint #2 – how to approach this? See if you can combine a few commands together! Plan out each of the steps you need to do, then put them all together. Click here to see an example solution # use that combined file grep &quot;@&quot; combined.fq | wc -l # a different way to do the same thing cat combined.fq | grep &quot;@&quot; | wc -l # or, combine the commands all together cat data_01_R1.fq data_54_R1.fq | grep &quot;@&quot; | wc -l ## 500 ## 500 ## 500 Can you explain why your solution works? Which solution above does yours look most similar to? Congratulations! You’ve successfully completed the exercise. BONUS: If you have extra time, use the skills you’ve learned to explore the fastq file format further: Count the total number of lines in the combined file. Using your answer from the exercise above (count the number of reads) – how are the number of reads related to the total number of lines in the file? Look at some of the contents of the combined fastq file. What do you notice about the structure of the file? Can you find any patterns? What do you think each line represents? What are some questions you have about the fastq file format? 2.5 Summary In this section, we’ve covered the basic commands for navigating directories, viewing and manipulating files, using pipes, and redirecting output. You’ve learned how to: Navigate to a directory List content in a directory Create a directory Copy a file Display content Search for patterns Display the number of words, lines, and characters Use pipes for redirection Use output redirection These are the fundamental commands you’ll need to work with files and directories on the HPC. In the next section, we’ll work through a real bioinformatics “mini-project” that builds on these commands, so you can see how they can be used together to solve a problem. Next: Bioinformatics Mini Project "],["mini-project.html", "Part 3 Mini Project 3.1 Start an Interactive Job 3.2 Create Directory 3.3 Copy Fastq Files To fastqs subdirectory 3.4 Use basic Linux commands to explore the fastq files 3.5 Working With Environment Modules 3.6 Run FastQC 3.7 Set up a job script to run Salmon to align the reads 3.8 Submit a Job 3.9 Examine the Standard Output (stdout) and Standard Error (stderr) log files 3.10 Use grep to find the TPMs for a specific gene 3.11 BONUS: Use an interactive job to run multiQC on the Salmon and FastQC output", " Part 3 Mini Project Here, we will combine some of the commands we have learned today to perform a toy bioinformatic analysis. Two human paired-end samples (four total fastq files) have already been downloaded from GSE52778 and are in the directory /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II/fastqs. To save time for the workshop, each file has been randomly subsetted to just a small fraction of the total reads. Here each user will: Copy these fastq files their own private project directory. Use basic Linux commands to learn some characteristics of these files. Use Salmon to align (pseudo-align) these reads to the hg38 reference transcriptome and get transcripts-per-million (TPMs) for each annotated gene. 3.1 Start an Interactive Job While simple file manipulations can be done on the submit node, computationally intensive operations should be performed using preallocated computational resources. An interactive job allows us to preallocate resources while still being able to run commands line by line. We will start an interactive job, requesting one CPU core and 1 hour and 30 minutes of walltime. srun -p quick --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --time=01:30:00 --pty bash After a job has been submitted, users can check on the status (e.g. how long it has been running) of it using the following. squeue --me 3.2 Create Directory Typically, one would work in their specific lab’s folder on the HPC. For this workshop, we will work in a common directory so that the instructors and check on your progress. cd /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II/ Create a directory based on your username to separate your work from other users’. mkdir &lt;username&gt; Navigate to the username directory cd &lt;username&gt; Create a fastqs directory inside the username directory. It is good practice to keep your raw data separate from your analyses and never make changes to them directly. mkdir fastqs Use ls to confirm the fastqs directory was created. ls 3.3 Copy Fastq Files To fastqs subdirectory Verify the current directory is in the username directory. pwd Copy the 4 fastq.gz files and md5sum.txt, which you will use to check the validty of the files. cp /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II/fastqs/*fastq.gz ./fastqs/ cp /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_II/fastqs/md5sum.txt ./fastqs/ Verify that the copied files are valid. The following code should return with an OK for each file. cd fastqs md5sum -c md5sum.txt ## SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz: OK ## SRR1039520_2.fastq.gz: OK ## SRR1039521_1.fastq.gz: OK ## SRR1039521_2.fastq.gz: OK Go back to the username directory. cd .. 3.4 Use basic Linux commands to explore the fastq files Notice all of the sequence data files end with a .gz extension, indicating they are gzip compressed. To view such files, one must use zcat instead of cat so that the files are decompressed into human-readable format. zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz | head ## @SRR1039520.19151550 19151550 length=63 ## CCAGGACATCAAGAAGCCAGCTGAAGATGAGTGGGGTAAAACCCCAGACGCCATGAAAGCTGC ## + ## HJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJIJJJJJJJJIJJJJJGGJJJFHIJIIJJIGHHFFFDDDDDCDDDCDD ## @SRR1039520.3404519 3404519 length=63 ## TGAGACATGGTTATAGATAAGAGAGTACAAAATGACTCTTTTTCCTGTCAATTGAAATTTAAA ## + ## HIGDFBGIIJBHGIIEHIIJIJIIIEGGIIIHGIJJIJJJIIJGIIIIGIEHIGDCHHIICG7 ## @SRR1039520.16253787 16253787 length=63 ## CAGGAGACCAAAGACACTGCAATTTGTGTGTTTTCTACAGGGTGCTTTAGATGACGTCTCATT zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_2.fastq.gz | head ## @SRR1039520.19151550 19151550 length=63 ## GAGATGGGGGTCCGTGCGGGCAGAACCCAGGGCATGAAGATCCAAAAGGGCCTGGTTCAGCTT ## + ## HJJJJJJJJJHHHIGIJIJJJJJJJHHHHFFFDDEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD ## @SRR1039520.3404519 3404519 length=63 ## TTTGACCCTAGTATTGGCAATAGCCCTTTGCTATTTATATAATTAAAACTTTTCTTTAAATTT ## + ## HIJIJJJJIIEHGIGIIIDGIJJJJIIJJJIJJJIJJJIIIJJJJIJJGCHIJJJJJIJIJII ## @SRR1039520.16253787 16253787 length=63 ## TACAGTTTGCAAAAGATGTCCAGATGGGTTCTTCTCAAATGAGACGTCATCTAAAGCACCCTG Notice that SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz and SRR1039520_2.fastq.gz files have the same read IDs. Valid paired fastq files always have matching read IDs throughout the entire file. Next, we can figure out how many reads are in a fastq file using wc -l. Recall that each read is represented by 4 lines in a fastq file, so we need to divide the results of wc -l by 4 to get the number of reads. zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz | wc -l ## 2000000 Finally, we can use wc -m to figure out the read length in a fastq file. Below, we use a combination of head -n2 and tail -n1 to get the second line of the first read. You may notice that the results of wc -m will be 1 higher than the actual read length. This is because the tool counts the newline character also. zcat fastqs/SRR1039520_1.fastq.gz | head -n2 | tail -n1 | wc -m ## 64 3.5 Working With Environment Modules Type module av bbc2 (modules beginning with just bbc are from the old HPC) to see all the software installed by the BBC. There are a lot of modules installed; to parse through these more easily, we can pipe the results of module av into grep to search for modules with specific keywords. There is a trick, though. The results of module av go to standard error, so we need to redirect standard error to standard out using 2&gt;&amp;1 before the pipe. This command will output any modules containing the fastqc keyword. module av -w 1 bbc2 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep &#39;fastqc&#39; ## bbc2/fastqc/fastqc-0.12.1 3.6 Run FastQC Create a fastqc directory inside of your username directory and run FastQC. module load bbc2/fastqc/fastqc-0.12.1 mkdir fastqc # Run FastQC.

These values can be found in the quant.sf file in each sample’s folder. First, let’s take a look at one of these files to figure out the format of these files. head salmon/SRR1039520/quant.sf ## Name Length EffectiveLength TPM NumReads ## ENST00000456328.2 1657 1502.149 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000450305.2 632 477.287 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000488147.1 1351 1196.149 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000619216.1 68 1.878 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000473358.1 712 557.240 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000469289.1 535 380.407 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000607096.1 138 24.897 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000417324.1 1187 1032.149 0.000000 0.000 ## ENST00000461467.1 590 435.330 0.000000 0.000 From the output above, we can see that the TPMs are in the 4th column of this file. The canonical transcript for MUC1 is ENST00000620103, so we will search for that using grep. grep &#39;ENST00000620103&#39; salmon/SRR1039520/quant.sf ## ENST00000620103.4 1811 1656.149 0.000000 0.000 Look for MUC1 across all the samples at the same time. We can see that ‘SRR1039521’ has a TPM of 13.1 for MUC1 compared to 0 for ‘SRR1039520’.

Instructions for running the RNA-seq workflow are on the Github README, but here we will go through each step in more detail. For a normal project, you would be working in your lab’s storage space, but for today we will work in the hpctmp folder. cd /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_III/ mkdir &lt;username&gt; cd &lt;username&gt; git clone https://github.com/vari-bbc/rnaseq_workflow.git rnaseq_workflow_testrun The Github repository consisting of the RNA-seq workflow should now be downloaded in a folder named rnaseq_workflow_testrun. cd rnaseq_workflow_testrun ls 4.1.3 Add your fastq files to raw_data/ Instead of making multiple copies of the same file, which can quickly use up your lab’s storage quota, we can use symbolic links. The sequence data that we will be using for this workshop are from the airway dataset referenced in the DESeq2 vignette. The gene counts can actually be downloaded as an R package. ls ../../0_fastqs/ ln -sr ../../0_fastqs/* ./raw_data You can see where the symbolic links are pointing to using ls -l. ls -l ./raw_data 4.1.4 Fill out the samplesheet The samplesheet is a tab-delimited file within config/samplesheet/ and is named units.tsv. The easiest way to fill this out is to run the helper script, make_units_template.sh, to generate a template, then edit using a text editor. FOR THIS WORKSHOP, NO CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE. cd config/samplesheet/ ./make_units_template.sh There should now be a file named ‘units_template.tsv’. ls We can replace the ‘units.tsv’ with ‘units_template.tsv’. cp units_template.tsv units.tsv Use cat to look at the samplesheet. cat units.tsv The “group” column in units.tsv needs to be edited. Use the built-in editor in OnDemand to correct this column according to the values below.

First, go to the base level of your “” directory. cd /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_III/&lt;username&gt; Then create the symlink. ln -s ../kin.lau/rnaseq_workflow/ . 4.3 Quality control It’s important to look through QC metrics to ensure that the data is likely to produce meaningful results. Ideally, you don’t want to waste time trying to interpret bad data. 4.3.1 multiQC report Use the OnDemand file explorer to download and open /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_III/&lt;username&gt;/rnaseq_workflow/results/multiqc/multiqc_report.html. Remember that within the OnDemand file explorer, you can click ‘Change directory’ to navigate directly to the enclosing directory. Alignment rate? Higher duplication rate can be normal for RNA-seq. Strandedness; In our workflow, this is automatically inferred using Salmon. Any contamination? Check FastqScreen results. 4.3.2 Other considerations Not a bad idea to look quickly at the alignments in IGV. Any sign of gDNA contamination? Mutations in specific genotypes? Is it exonic? Can do a quick check in IGV. How many genes expressed? Easy to check in R. Marker genes? Can do a quick check in iSEE if you expect certain expression patterns between groups. Any genes supposed to knocked out or knocked down? Use iSEE. Does the PCA show clustering? Use iSEE. 4.4 DE analysis using R and DESeq2 4.4.1 Create an R project Please go to VAI OnDemand. Click on RStudio Server, and create a new RStudio session. Please make sure you are loading the correct R module for this workshop, bbc2/R/alt/R-4.4.0-setR_LIBS_USER, which you can select from the drop down menu. Type “quick” in the “Partition” field. can be “quick” (if you encounter issues, you can also try “short” or “long”). Set CPU as 1, memory as 16GB, and time as 6 hours. Click “Launch”. In the Rstudio window, click “File” in the upper left corner, click on “New Project” &gt; “New Directory” &gt; “New Project”. Then, click on “Browse…”, you can click on triple dot horizontal button and type /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_III/&lt;username&gt;. Click “choose”. Next, you will go back to the project wizard, and type “workshop_2024” in the “Directory name” field. Click “Create Project”. You will be the newly created “workshop_2024” folder, which will contain a new file named “workshop_2024.Rproj”, which Rstudio uses to store details about your R project. 4.4.1.1 Why create R projects? Creating an R Project in RStudio is recommended for several reasons: A R Project creates a dedicated working directory for your project files, including R scripts, data files, figures, and output. This helps in organizing your files that are related to a specific project. Automatic working directory setup. When you open an R Project, RStudio automatically sets the working directory to the project folder. Reproducibility. With a project-based setup, the code and files related to a project stay together, making it easier to reproduce results. Version control integration and package development support. 4.4.2 Exploring the data using iSEE The iSEE app allows us to explore our data interactively, making changes on-the-fly. It is more convenient to mount the HPC storage to your computer and run iSEE locally, but for simplicity we will follow the steps below to run iSEE via OnDemand Rstudio. Go to the terminal. Go to your newly created workshop_2024 R project directory, then copy app.R and sce.rds from rnaseq_workflow/iSEE/ to there. cd /varidata/researchtemp/hpctmp/BBC_workshop_Oct2024_III/&lt;username&gt;/workshop_2024 cp ../rnaseq_workflow/iSEE/* . To run the iSEE app, go back to OnDemand Rstudio, open the app.R file and click “Source”. iSEE screenshot. 4.4.3 Make a separate folder for DE analysis and a script file to store our commands We will create a new folder for the differential expression analysis of this workshop. Click “New Folder” and enter “DE_genes” for the folder name. Create an R script file to record the code that you will use for this part of the workshop today. Click on the “DE_genes” folder to enter it. Click “New Blank File” &gt; “R script”. Type in “deseq2.R” for the filename and click “OK”. Unless otherwise noted, run all following code by copying and pasting into “deseq2.R” then highlighting the commands you want to run and typing either Cmd + Enter (Mac) or Ctrl + Enter (Windows). 4.4.4 Make an output directory To ensure it is clear which files are produced by a given script, it is good practice to make a unique folder for storing each script’s output. outdir &lt;- &quot;./DE_genes/deseq2_out_files/&quot; dir.create(outdir, recursive=TRUE) 4.4.5 Install packages For this workshop, we ran the Rstudio job with the bbc2/R/alt/R-4.4.0-setR_LIBS_USER module. This allows you to use R packages that we have installed beforehand. For your actual work, we encourage you to run Rstudio jobs with the bbc2/R/R-4.4.0 module which will allows you to make and maintain your own R package library, avoiding permission issues when updating packages or installing new ones. While CRAN packages can be installed with install.packages(), Bioconductor packages have to be installed with the install() function in the BiocManager package. # AS EXPLAINED ABOVE, NO NEED TO RUN THESE FOR THE WORKSHOP # if (!require(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) # install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) # # BiocManager::install(c(&quot;dplyr&quot;,&quot;stringr&quot;,&quot;ggplot2&quot;,&quot;readr&quot;,&quot;ggrepel&quot;,&quot;ComplexHeatmap&quot;,&quot;DESeq2&quot;,&quot;iSEE&quot;)) 4.4.6 Load packages In order to let R know where to look for the functions we will use, we need to load them using the library() function. The suppressPackageStartupMessages() function calls here are simply to mute the automatic start-up messages of some of these packages to avoid cluttering what we are looking at. suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr)) library(stringr) library(ggplot2) library(readr) library(ggrepel) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ComplexHeatmap)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(DESeq2)) 4.4.7 Set up your DESeq object The BBC Snakemake workflow collates all the gene counts into an R object saved in the results/SummarizedExperiment/SummarizedExperiment.rds file. The readRDS function loads that object into our environment. se &lt;- readRDS(&quot;../rnaseq_workflow/results/SummarizedExperiment/SummarizedExperiment.rds&quot;) # What is type of object is this? class(se) 4.4.8 What is a SummarizedExperiment object? A SummarizedExperiment object allows us to store and manipulate sample meta data, gene meta data and gene counts in separate, coordinated dataframes and matrices. Subsetting and reordering samples or genes can be done using the familiar object[row, column] R syntax, where the genes are the rows and the samples are the columns (object[genes, samples]). Later on, we will go through some exercises to further demonstrate the usefulness of “SummarizedExperiment” objects. SummarizedExperiment Let’s take a look to see what assays are stored in the SummarizedExperiment object. Note that DESeq2 requires the first assay to be named “counts” and assumes it contains the raw counts. assayNames(se) ## [1] &quot;counts&quot; &quot;tpms&quot; &quot;vst&quot; stopifnot(assayNames(se)[1] == &quot;counts&quot;) Let’s take a look at the sample meta data in the “se” object.

It can be difficult to look at so many genes, and sometimes a list of genes do not provide any biological insights. Enrichment and pathway analyses are performed to determine if there is any known biological functions, interactions or pathways in your DE gene studies. Generally speaking, Enrichment and pathway analyses are not restricted for DE gene expression, they can be performed on proteomics data, ChIP-seq, and genomic data as well. There are different algorithms for enrichment and pathway analyses. In this session, we will focus on two types: ORA (over representation analysis) and GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis). 5.3 ORA ORA explores whether there is enrichment of known biological functions or pathways in a particular set of genes (e.g. significantly up- or down-regulated genes). Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) are two broadly used databases that are curated for exploring pathways and gene functions. GO is a framework used to represent and categorize gene functions across different species in a standardized manner. It provides a controlled vocabulary that describes genes in terms of their associated biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. The Gene Ontology Consortium maintains the GO vocabulary, as known as GO terms. Click to expand More details on GO terms: To describe the roles of genes and gene products, GO terms are organized into three independent components in a species-independent manner: Biological process: refers to the biological role involving the gene or gene product, and could include “transcription”, “signal transduction”, and “apoptosis”. Molecular function: represents the biochemical activity of the gene product, such activities could include “ligand”, “protein binding”, and “enzyme activity”. Cellular component: refers to the location in the cell of the gene product, such as “lysosome” and “plasma membrane”. The GO terms are loosely hierarchical, ranging from general, ‘parent’, terms to more specific, ‘child’ terms. In this session, we will be mostly using clusterProfiler to conduct enrichment analyses. In the ORA here, we will be testing whether 2 fold up-regulated (logfold-change = 1, as log fold change is often log2 based) genes are enriched in which GO terms. We will be using enrichGO function from clusterProfiler, and use the whole dataset (~20,000 genes) as the background (universe in enrichGO function). ## only getting DE genes at least have 2 fold change, so log2FC &gt; 1, only up-regulated genes. genes_2f_up &lt;- de_res |&gt; filter(padj &lt; fdr_cutoff &amp; log2FoldChange &gt; 1) message(&quot;Number of DE genes have at least 2 fold change is: &quot;, nrow(genes_2f_up)) ## Number of DE genes have at least 2 fold change is: 246 ego_BP &lt;- enrichGO(gene = as.character(genes_2f_up$entrez), universe = as.character(de_res$entrez), OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db, ont = &quot;BP&quot;, pAdjustMethod = &quot;BH&quot;, qvalueCutoff = 0.05, keyType = &quot;ENTREZID&quot;, readable = TRUE) 5.3.1 plot ORA results Dotplots can be used to depict the enrichment scores (e.g. p values) and gene count or ratio as circle size and colors. Cneplots, gene-concept network, allows us to know which genes are involved in these significant GO terms or pathways, as well as the linkages among GO terms or pathways. dotplot(ego_BP, showCategory = 20, font.size = 9 ) + ggtitle(&quot;dotplot for ORA - BP&quot;) cnetplot(ego_BP, showCategory = 10, node_label_size = 0.6, cex_label_category = 0.8, cex_label_gene = 0.5, cex_category = 0.8, cex_genes = 0.5, max.overlaps = Inf) + ggtitle(&quot;Gene-concept network for ORA - GO:BP&quot;) 5.3.2 save ORA results to a tsv file You can easily load this into Excel ego_BP_df &lt;- ego_BP |&gt; as.data.frame() ## output the BP enrichment results into a tsv file write_tsv(ego_BP_df, paste0(outdir, &quot;/clusterProfiler_BP_res.tsv&quot;)) Click to expand Exercise on your own: Try to rerun the analyses: Using the same conditions, return the enriched GO processes for the Molecular Function ontology. How would the enrichGO() function change if our organism was mouse? 5.4 GSEA ORA is based on these differentially expressed genes. This approach will find genes where the difference is large and will fail where the difference is small, but evidenced in coordinated way in a set of related genes. GSEA directly addresses this limitation. Unlike ORA where an arbitrary threshold is set as “significant DE genes”, all genes can be used in GSEA. We usually sort genes based on their fold changes or p-values, and compare this sorted gene list to a predefined gene set, such as genes in certain pathways. It will help to detect situations where all genes in a predefined set change in a small but coordinated manner. P-values are generated through permutation tests. This type of analysis can be particularly helpful if the differential expression analysis only outputs a small number of significant DE genes. Here, what we create is a sorted list of all genes (~20,000 genes) in our dataset sorted by -log10(pvalue) and sign of fold change; this way, up-regulated and down-regulated genes will be at the top and bottom of the list. In GSEA, we will show how to run GSEA on KEGG pathways ## we will use all the genes. Get the fold change and pvalues. gene_list &lt;- sign(de_res$log2FoldChange) * -log10(de_res$pvalue) ## or we can just use fold change data. ## get the name of the genes. names(gene_list) &lt;- de_res$entrez ## the names of the gene list is the en ID. ## remove NA is there is any in the fold change or gene names if(any(is.na(gene_list))){ gene_list = gene_list[-which(is.na(gene_list))] } if(any(is.na(names(gene_list)))) { gene_list = gene_list[-which(is.na(names(gene_list)))] } ## also remove duplicated gene names gene_list &lt;- gene_list[!duplicated(names(gene_list))] ## sort from largest to smallest. gene_list &lt;- sort(gene_list, decreasing = TRUE) head(gene_list) ## 115207 6536 9181 165215 338382 1277 ## 43.56579 42.34242 32.18764 31.64835 29.16647 28.73637 # set seeds set.seed(1234) ## run GSEA using clusterProfiler gseaKEGG &lt;- gseKEGG(geneList = gene_list, # ordered named vector of fold changes (Entrez IDs are the associated names) organism = &quot;hsa&quot;, nPerm = 1000, # default number permutations minGSSize = 100, # minimum gene set size (# genes in set) - change to test more sets or recover sets with fewer # genes pvalueCutoff = 0.1, # padj cutoff value verbose = FALSE, eps = 0) ## Reading KEGG annotation online: &quot;https://rest.kegg.jp/link/hsa/pathway&quot;... ## Reading KEGG annotation online: &quot;https://rest.kegg.jp/list/pathway/hsa&quot;... gseaKEGG_gene_symbol &lt;- setReadable(gseaKEGG, &#39;org.Hs.eg.db&#39;, &#39;ENTREZID&#39;) 5.4.1 save gsea results # gsea is a large list, and we convert it to a data frame, and save the results gsea_df &lt;- gseaKEGG_gene_symbol |&gt; as.data.frame() write_tsv(gsea_df, paste0(outdir, &quot;/clusterProfiler_KEGG_GSEA_res.tsv&quot;)) 5.4.2 plot GSEA results Similarity, we can make dotplot and gene-concept network plots here. # first dotplot dotplot(gseaKEGG_gene_symbol, showCategory = 15) + ggtitle(&quot;dotplot for gsea - KEGG pathways&quot;) cnetplot(gseaKEGG_gene_symbol, showCategory = 5, node_label_size = 0.6, cex_label_category = 0.8, cex_label_gene = 0.5, cex_category = 0.8, cex_genes = 0.5, max.overlaps = Inf) + ggtitle(&quot;Gene-concept network for gsea-KEGG pathways&quot;) # Specific plots we can make for GSEA results gseaplot(gseaKEGG_gene_symbol, geneSetID = &#39;hsa04910&#39;) 5.4.3 plot KEGG map # Lastly, we can map gene expression to a KEGG map foldchanges &lt;- de_res$log2FoldChange names(foldchanges) &lt;- de_res$entrez pathview(gene.data = foldchanges, pathway.id = &#39;hsa04910&#39;, species = &quot;hsa&quot;, limit = list(gene = 2, # value gives the max/min limit for foldchanges cpd = 1), low=list(gene=&quot;steelblue&quot;), high=list(gene=&quot;gold&quot;)) ## you can download the map from Rstudio, and you will be seeing something like this. Example pathview output. 5.5 Other R packages and tools We introduced a few commonly used R packages to conduct enrichment and pathway analyses. Other popular tools and R packages include: - g:Profiler: a web based toolfor functional profiling of gene or protein lists. - gprofiler2, an R interface (package) to the widely used web toolset g:Profiler. - Revigo: if you have a long list Gene Ontology terms, Revigo can nd summarize them by removing redundant GO terms. - aPear: generate an enrichment network from enrichment results, works seamlessly with clusterProfiler. - cytospace: an open source software platform for visualizing complex networks. Cytospace offer many apps (formerly known as plugins) to extends its functionalities, and see here for a workflow of how to visualize omics data using Cytospace and its apps.
